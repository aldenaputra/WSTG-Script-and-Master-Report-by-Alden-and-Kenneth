[i] Note: HTTP Smuggling tests may require manual verification:
2025-08-05 01:14:05.301013 |     - Check server logs for abnormal requests
2025-08-05 01:14:05.301538 |     - Test with a proxy to observe request parsing
2025-08-05 01:14:05.301538 |     - Verify with different intermediaries (proxies, WAFs)
